Working Process: 

I have separated this landing page with three major section. 

Header 

Main content 

Footer 

 

1. Header: There are 2 inner items on this. I’ve used [.top-nav] class for top nav bar and [header] tag for main navigation header. [uk-sticky] attribute fulfill the main navigation header to sticky top when scroll down.  

2. Main Content: All the sections of this template are codded here step by step. All of the sections separated with individual IDs. You can navigate those easily from main navigation header.  

3. Footer: You can change footer options by following comments (notes). 

 

#Extra: 

Home Banner Slider: Used UiKit to setup this. You can change banner images from [.uk-background-cover] class and paste image path at [data-src="..."] attribute. 

Testimonials Slider: It’s built with [OWL Carousel]. You can control Carousel options from app.js file. See [OWL Carousel] documentation for more.
